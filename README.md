# National Park Explorer

National Park Explorer was developed as a capstone project in the Thinkful Engineering Flex program.

## Purpose

This application takes advantage of the [National Park Service API](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/digital/nps-data-api.htm). Users will be able to search states to discover all of the amazing activities the National Park Service has to offer. The application will allow users to create a profile, rate parks, save favorites, and comment on their experience at the various locations. This set of features is just a starting place, the MVP, of an application that could grow into a social hub on the amazing resources available to the public through the National Park Service.

## Future of App

While this iteration focuses on the NPS, there is tremendous growth opportunity into other outdoor recreation pursuits.

## API

- [National Park Service API](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/index.htm) - The National Park Service API (application programming interface) and developer resources are designed to provide authoritative NPS data and content for internal and external developers creating apps, maps, and websites. You'll find photos and essential information about NPS sites including visitor centers, campgrounds, events, news, alerts, and more, as well as detailed articles about NPS natural and cultural features and important people and places.

## Available Scripts

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
